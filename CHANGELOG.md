Change from 2.7 to 2.7.1:
New items (e.g. ADSBs) are added. This is a rebuild using the free fontawesome version instead of pro. In consequence, some icons might not be shown. But i rather like to see all the new items instead.

# v2.7.0

- Dungeon Tracker
  - Add / update handling for Beginner's Hall and Secret Hunt
- Record Materia
  - Add Alisaie

  - Online comments suggest that the "Always show timer" option no longer works, so it's been removed.

  - Update for the release of Hero Board in GL.
  - Allow sorting of Hero Board abilities by character, realm, or release date.

  - The list of relic draw banners now summarizes the chances of getting a selected relic on each banner.

  - Fix: Unknown relics are now shown as ??? instead of breaking the entire relic banner page

There have been some reports of FFRK accounts getting flagged for cheating. To the best of my knowledge, this has nothing to do with RK²; however:

- RK² is more careful to not make unnecessary modifications to network data.
- If you were using the option to always show the in-game timer, it's been switched off and must be explicitly enabled again.
- Cautionary notes have been added to any options that modify FFRK behavior.

- Soul Breaks
  - Fix a layout glitch in Shared Soul Breaks page
- Relic Draws
  - Add Relic Draw Simulator
  - Add support for calculating probabilities for 2xG5 banners

  - Known issue: 2xG5 banners are only properly detected for English language games.

- Experimental transparent proxy support (BlueStacks support)
- Add the option to hide accolades from the roaming warrior list (to save screen space)

  - RK Squared now offers the option of keeping recently closed relic banners. For example, you can review the last few days of a fest, or you could save up history for JP to use as foresight for GL. By default, banners are kept 4 days after closing; you can change this under the Options screen.
  - Lucky draws (as well as the "All Relics" section of dream selects) are now grouped by realm.
- Miscellaneous
